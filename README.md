 # ðŸ“„ Java Document Editor
## Overview
This repository contains a modular Document Editor built with Java, leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, design patterns, and file/database persistence strategies. It supports rendering text, images, tab spaces, and new lines, with output saved to a .txt file or a simulated database. The project demonstrates clean architecture using interfaces, composition, and design patterns like Composite and Strategy.
